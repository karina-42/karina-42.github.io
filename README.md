## Informal Code Review

This is an informal code review of the original artifact as created and submitted in my IT 140 course. I check the code against a checklist, identifying potential security issues, bugs, and pointing out potential fixes and enhancements plans.

This is the original artifact I worked on for all three enhancements. It was created in IT-140 in my first term at Southern New Hampshire University. It is a text-based game played in the console. It is written in procedural code in Python. Users type commands starting with "go" or "get" to go in a certain direction to change rooms and to get items in those rooms. When they get to the room with the villain, el Chupacabras, if players have all the items in the house, they win the game, otherwise they lose.

### Enhancement One - Software Design and Engineering
