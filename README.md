# Karina's ePortfolio

## Professional Self-Assessment

I first became interested in coding several years ago when, as an assistant language teacher in Japan, I began creating games in PowerPoint for teaching my students. Wanting more creative freedom and realizing how helpful educational games could be for learning, I started teaching myself how to code. My goal was to make interactive websites that could help my students, but I realized how much I enjoyed building software. Eventually, I developed a desire to switch careers to developing software and websites to support teachers and students.

I started by learning HTML and CSS, then moved on to JavaScript. After I became comfortable making static websites, I began to explore making full stack sites using MongoDB, Express, and Node. When I started to look for work in software engineering, my lack of formal education gave me difficulties, so I decided to pursue a second bachelor’s degree in computer science.

Through this program I was exposed to many aspects of the software engineering career that I was not familiar with yet. I learned about the software development lifecycle, how to write clear documentation for stakeholders, and planning projects through diagrams and sketches before even writing the first line of code. I also developed new skills in writing strong tests, enforcing input validation, and understanding the importance of security and the ethical responsibility of developers to protect user privacy and to consider the social impact of technologies like artificial intelligence.

I participated in discussion posts that helped improve my communicative and teamwork skills. Many posts involved researching a problem, explaining it, and discussing our solutions. In one course, I learned how to collaborate in teams by simulating working on an Agile scrum team for a discussion post with three other online students. That experience taught me that when working on a team with members that have different solutions to the same problem, it is important to listen to other people’s point of view and value their perspectives and experiences. I also built a foundation in data structures and algorithms, learning about the benefits and drawbacks of each and how to choose the best tool for different tasks. Some courses exposed me to new areas of computer science, like creating a 3D rendering of a 2D image, and the history and ethics of AI, which have inspired me to look into other possible career choices and areas of learning after graduating.

As a developer, I learned the importance of writing clean, maintainable code and continuously learning about new tools and expanding my knowledge. I am already planning out new projects to make after graduating, some in collaboration with other students, to continue learning and go deeper into topics that were introduced in the courses.

Everything I learned throughout the program is demonstrated in my capstone project. In my first term at Southern New Hampshire University, I took a course where I learned Python and created a text-based game for my final project. The player navigates a set of rooms, collects items, and faces a villain in one of the rooms. They do not know what room the villain is in, so the goal is to collect all the items before running into it. In my version, the villain is a Chupacabras, and the setting is the player’s house, with the Chupacabras in the backyard. Initially, the game was written procedurally and ran only in the console. I wanted to share it with friends and family back home, but I did not know how to make it accessible to them. I tried to create a front end but since I had little experience with Python and its frameworks, I did not know how, and the following courses along with full-time work and other obligations left me with little free time to work on it. Finally, this capstone presented me with the opportunity to enhance it the way I had wanted to. 

I began with a code review of the original project, using a checklist to find errors and areas of improvement, simulating a professional peer review process. For the first enhancement, I refactored the code into an object-oriented design, improving maintainability and reusability. I also fixed the in-code comments and provided documentation through docstrings, showing my ability to communicate and structure code collaboratively. For the second enhancement, I demonstrated my knowledge of data structures and algorithms by organizing the rooms data into a graph structure and using a Breadth-First Search algorithm to implement a hints feature that helps players by giving directions to the nearest room with an item. Lastly, I turned the program into a full stack application with a database of users. Players can now register, log in, and have their play times recorded if they end the game successfully, so they can try to beat their time. Future iterations will include enhancements to be able to see other users’ best times and have a scoreboard. Due to the enhancements in this capstone project, I have set myself up to be able to enhance the game more in the future. For example, by using a graph structure and factory pattern to create the rooms, I can now easily add new rooms and open the possibility of randomizing the connections between the rooms to increase replayability. Ultimately, I will be able to share with my friends and family a greatly enhanced version of the game I wanted to share when I first started this program, and that I can continue to enhance in future versions. 

This ePortfolio holds the original artifact, the code review, and the three enhancements with their reflections that showcase my range of skills and abilities I developed throughout the computer science program. Each enhancement builds on the previous one, showing my growth as a developer capable of building scalable and maintainable applications. Together, these artifacts demonstrate my ability to apply communication and collaboration skills, algorithmic problem-solving, database management, creativity, and willingness to learn and apply new tools and techniques.

## Informal Code Review

This is an informal code review of the original artifact as created and submitted in my IT 140 course. I check the code against a checklist, identifying potential security issues, bugs, and pointing out potential fixes and enhancements plans.
